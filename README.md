Term Project 
Controlling Structural Vibrations. 
Purpose. 
The purpose of   this project is to investigate problems related to vibrations in structures. The       nonlinear   response   of   selected   structures   may   also   be   investigated. A   list   of   topics   that   can   be investigated is provided below:
1) Vibrations induced by people: Pedestrian bridges; Floors with walking people; Floors   for sport or dance activities;   Floors with fixed   seating   and   spectator   galleries;
High-diving platforms
2) Machinery-induced vibrations: Machine foundations and supports; Bell towers;   Structure-borne sound; Ground-transmitted vibrations
3) Wind-induced vibrations: Buildings; Towers; Chimneys and Masts; Guyed Masts;   Pylons;   Suspension and Cable-Stayed Bridges; Cantilevered Roofs
4) Vibrations induced by traffic and construction activity: Roads; Railways;   Bridges;   Construction Work
5) Earthquake-induced vibrations: Buildings; Bridges; Dams; Towers; Chimneys and   Masts; Underground structures.
If   there is a topic of   interest to you that is not included   in the   list   above, please   discuss   it   with   the   course instructor.
Project Requirements. 
A) Topic Selection: Select   one   structural   system   that   maybe   sensitive   to   vibrations   for   your investigation.          A good starting point are the papers from the Journal   of Sound and Vibration, the Journal   of   Earthquake   Engineering   and   Structural   Dynamics   and   the   proceedings   of   the International Modal Analysis Conference (IMAC) and the International Operational   Analysis   Conference (IOMAC).          Consult with the course instructor before proceeding with your term   paper. 
B) Literature Review: Conduct   a   critical   review   of   the   literature   regarding   the   vibration problems associated with the structure selected, and how   such problems   can be minimized   or removed completely. Identify proposed methods to control or minimize vibrations and discuss   their merits and limitations. 
C) Case Studies: Select two (2) case studies to illustrate how a vibration   can be minimized   or controlled.   You may use simple hand calculations or more sophisticated computer analysis   to   show how your method is effective in controlling vibrations. Provide a   clear description   of each   problem   and   discuss   the   general   applicability   of   the   solution   method   used.
All assumptions must be   justifiable and clearly stated. You can   also   select   a proposed method   of   vibration   control   and   demonstrate   why  代 写CIVIL 507 - 2024 Term Project Controlling Structural Vibrations.C/C++

Your report   will   be   submitted   in   electronic form. only, and will consist of   two parts.   The two parts   of   the report   should be electronically submitted via CANVAS. E-mailing the report to the course instructor is permitted, but if   the files are too big they should be submitted in   a   CD   or USB memory   stick.
The first part is your report about the literature search   and   a   summary   of   your   findings. The two   case   studies   will   also   be   part   of   this   report. If   computer   analyses   are   conducted   as   part   of this work, the input and output files should   also be   submitted. The   suggested   length   of   the body   of   your   report   is   not   more   than   25 pages. Copies   of   papers   and   reference   material   can   also   be submitted as appendices. There is no limit on the number   of   pages   included   in   the   appendices.
The second part of   your report will consist of   a PowerPoint presentation that   summarizes in   12   slides or less the work that you have done.
Submission deadline. 
The submission date of   the report is 6th   December at   23:00.   Reports   submitted   after the   deadline   will be deducted   10 marks/day
Project Evaluation 
The submitted report will be evaluated in terms of   its presentation and content.   Marks   will be assigned as   follows:
